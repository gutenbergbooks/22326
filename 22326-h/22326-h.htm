<p><b>Abbreviations</b> are shown as superscripts. The word shown as
<b>y<sup>e</sup></b> was printed with the <b>e</b> directly above the
<b>y</b>:&nbsp;yͤ. Not all browsers can display this form correctly.
Abbreviations in <sup>t</sup> (<i>what, that</i>) were similarly
written; note that the second occurrence of <b>þ<sup>t</sup></b> uses
true thorn, not the more common <b>y</b>. The “-us” abbreviation,
similar to a small <sup>9</sup>, is shown here as <sup>us</sup>. In
verse, abbreviations were used only when a long line had to be shortened
to fit the width of the page.</p>

<p><b>Damaged Words</b> were reconstructed based on surviving parts of
letters. Some reconstructions are more secure than others.</p>

The word “tens” was used in the text because it occurs elsewhere in
conjunction with “future”.</p>

The words “mayes touche” are not completely satisfactory, but the text
demands a word-final <b>s</b>.</p>

Much of this is obviously conjectural. The likeliest endings for the
first two lines are “tendre” and “fayre”.</p>
